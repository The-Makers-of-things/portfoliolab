class CriticalLineAlgorithm:

    """
    This class implements the famous Critical Line Algorithm (CLA) for mean-variance portfolio optimisation. It is reproduced with
    modification from the following paper: `D.H. Bailey and M.L. Prado “An Open-Source Implementation of the Critical- Line
    Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization”,Algorithms, 6 (2013), 169-196. <http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/a6010169>`_.

    The Critical Line Algorithm is a famous portfolio optimisation algorithm used for calculating the optimal allocation weights
    for a given portfolio. It solves the optimisation problem with optimisation constraints on each weight - lower and upper
    bounds on the weight value. This class can compute multiple types of solutions:

    1. CLA Turning Points
    2. Minimum Variance
    3. Maximum Sharpe
    4. Efficient Frontier Allocations
