        De-noises the covariance matrix or the correlation matrix.

        Two denoising methods are supported:
        1. Constant Residual Eigenvalue Method (``const_resid_eigen``)
        2. Spectral Method (``spectral``)
        3. Targeted Shrinkage Method (``target_shrink``)

        The Constant Residual Eigenvalue Method works as follows:

        First, a correlation is calculated from the covariance matrix (if the input is the covariance matrix).

        Second, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix are calculated using the linalg.eigh
        function from numpy package.

        Third, a maximum theoretical eigenvalue is found by fitting Marcenko-Pastur (M-P) distribution
        to the empirical distribution of the correlation matrix eigenvalues. The empirical distribution
        is obtained through kernel density estimation using the KernelDensity class from sklearn.
        The fit of the M-P distribution is done by minimizing the Sum of Squared estimate of Errors
        between the theoretical pdf and the kernel. The minimization is done by adjusting the variation
        of the M-P distribution.

        Fourth, the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix are sorted and the eigenvalues lower than
        the maximum theoretical eigenvalue are set to their average value. This is how the eigenvalues
        associated with noise are shrinked. The de-noised covariance matrix is then calculated back
        from new eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

        The Spectral Method works just like the Constant Residual Eigenvalue Method, but instead of replacing
        eigenvalues lower than the maximum theoretical eigenvalue to their average value, they are replaced with
        zero instead.

        The Targeted Shrinkage Method works as follows:

        First, a correlation is calculated from the covariance matrix (if the input is the covariance matrix).

        Second, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix are calculated using the linalg.eigh
        function from numpy package.

        Third, the correlation matrix composed from eigenvectors and eigenvalues related to noise is
        shrunk using the alpha variable. The shrinkage is done by summing the noise correlation matrix
        multiplied by alpha to the diagonal of the noise correlation matrix multiplied by (1-alpha).

        Fourth, the shrinked noise correlation matrix is summed to the information correlation matrix.

        Correlation matrix can also be detoned by excluding a number of first eigenvectors representing
        the market component.

        These algorithms are reproduced with minor modifications from the following book:
