        Calculates the Theory-Implied Correlation (TIC) matrix.

        Includes three steps.

        In the first step, the theoretical tree graph structure of the assets is fit on the evidence
        presented by the empirical correlation matrix.

        The result of the first step is a binary tree (dendrogram) that sequentially clusters two elements
        together, while measuring how closely together the two elements are, until all elements are
        subsumed within the same cluster.

        In the second step, a correlation matrix is derived from the linkage object.

        Each cluster in the global linkage object is decomposed into two elements,
        which can be either atoms or other clusters. Then the off-diagonal correlation between two
        elements is calculated based on the distances between them.

        In the third step, the correlation matrix is de-noised.

        This is done by fitting the Marcenko-Pastur distribution to the eigenvalues of the matrix, calculating the
        maximum theoretical eigenvalue as a threshold and shrinking the eigenvalues higher than a set threshold.
        This algorithm is implemented in the RiskEstimators class.

        the distance becomes zero and one if they are different to a maximum
        extent.

        This can be used to measure to which extent the TIC matrix has blended
        theory-implied views (tree structure of the elements) with empirical
        evidence (correlation matrix).
