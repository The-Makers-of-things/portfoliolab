    This class implements the Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion strategy. It is reproduced with
    modification from the following paper:
    `D. Huang, J. Zhou, B. Li, S. C. H. Hoi and S. Zhou, "Robust Median Reversion Strategy for
    Online Portfolio Selection," in IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, vol. 28,

    Robust Median Reversion uses a L1-median of historical prices to predict the next time's
    price relative returns. The new weights is then regularized to retain previous portfolio
    information but also seeks to maximize returns from the predicted window.

        Initializes Robust Median Reversion with the given epsilon, n_iteration, window, and tau values.

        :param epsilon: (float) Reversion threshold with range [1, inf). Values of [15, 25] had the
                                highest returns for the original dataset provided by the authors.
        :param n_iteration: (int) Maximum number of iterations with range [2, inf). Iteration of 200
                                  produced a adequate balance between performance and computational
                                  time for the strategy.
        :param window: (int) Size of window with range [2, inf). Typically window of 2, 7, or 21
                             produced the highest results. This parameter depends on the underlying
                             data's price movements and mean reversion tendencies.
        :param tau: (float) Toleration level with range [0, 1). It is suggested to keep the toleration
                            level at 0.001 for computational efficiency.
