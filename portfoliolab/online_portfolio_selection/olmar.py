    def __init__(self, reversion_method, epsilon, window=None, alpha=None):
        """
        Initializes Online Moving Average Reversion with the given reversion method, epsilon,
        window, and alpha.

        :param reversion_method: (int) 1 for SMA, 2 for EWA. Typically 2 has higher returns than 1,
                                       but this is dependant on the dataset.
        :param epsilon: (float) Reversion threshold with range [1, inf). OLMAR methods typically do
                                not rely on epsilon values as it is more dependant on the window and
                                alpha value; however, epsilon of 20 seems to be a safe choice to
                                avoid extreme values.
        :param window: (int) Number of windows to calculate Simple Moving Average with range [1, inf).
                             This parameter depends on the data. If the data has a shorter mean reversion
                             trends, then window of 6 can have high returns. If the data has a longer
                             mean reversion trend, then values close to 21 can have high returns.
        :param alpha: (float) Exponential ratio for Exponentially Weighted Average with range (0, 1).
                              Larger alpha value indicates more importance placed on recent prices,
                              and smaller alpha value indicates more importance placed on the past.
