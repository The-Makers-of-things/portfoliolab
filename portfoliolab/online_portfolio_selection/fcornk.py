    This class implements the Functional Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning - K strategy. It

    Functional Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning - K formulates a number of FCORN experts and
    tracks the experts performance over time. Each period, the strategy decides to allocate capital
    to the top-k experts until the previous time period. This strategy takes an ensemble approach to
    the top performing experts.

        Initializes Functional Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning - K with the given number
        of window, rho, lambda, and k experts.

        :param window: (int) Number of windows to look back for similarity sets. Generates
                             experts with range of [1, 2, ..., w]. The window ranges typically work
                             well with shorter terms of [1, 7].
        :param rho: (int) Number of rho values for threshold. Generates experts with range of
                          [0, 1, (rho-1)/rho]. Higher rho values allow for a greater coverage of
                          possible parameters, but it will slow down the calculations. Rho ranges
                          typically work well with [3, 5].
        :param lambd: (int) Number of scale factors for sigmoid function. Generates experts with range
                            of [1, 10, 10 ** (lambd - 1)]. Higher lambd values allow for a greater
                            coverage of possible parameters, but it will slow down the calculations.
                            Lambd ranges typically work well with [1, 3].
        :param k: (int) Number of top-k experts. K values have range of [1, window * rho]. Higher
                        number of experts gives a higher exposure to a number of strategies. K value of
                        1 or 2 had the best results as some parameters significantly outperform others.
