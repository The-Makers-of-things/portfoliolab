    Confidence Weighted Mean Reversion exploits both the popular mean reversion techniques and
    second-order information to model weights as a gaussian distribution.

                                   value directly affects the results. Typically the extreme values of
                                   0 and 1 have the highest returns. A low value indicates a wider
