    This class implements the Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning - K strategy. It is
    reproduced with modification from the following paper:
    `Li, B., Hoi, S.C., & Gopalkrishnan, V. (2011). CORN: Correlation-driven nonparametric
    learning approach for portfolio selection. ACM TIST, 2,
    21:1-21:29. <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1961189.1961193>`_

    Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning - K formulates a number of experts and tracks the
    experts performance over time. Each period, the strategy decides to allocate capital to
    the top-k experts until the previous time period. This strategy takes an ensemble approach to
    the top performing experts.

        """
        Initializes Correlation Driven Nonparametric Learning - K with the given number of
        windows, rho values, and k experts.

        :param window: (int) Number of windows to look back for similarity sets. Generates
                             experts with range of [1, 2, ..., w]. The window ranges typically work
                             well with shorter terms of [1, 7].
        :param rho: (int) Number of rho values for threshold. Generates experts with range of
                          [0, 1, (rho-1)/rho]. Higher rho values allow for a greater coverage of
                          possible parameters, but it will slow down the calculations. Rho ranges
                          typically work well with [2, 7].
        :param k: (int) Number of top-k experts. K values have range of [1, window * rho]. Higher
                        number of experts gives a higher exposure to a number of strategies. K value of
                        1 or 2 had the best results as some parameters significantly outperform others.
