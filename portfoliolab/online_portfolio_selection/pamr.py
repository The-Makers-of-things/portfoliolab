    This class implements the Passive Aggressive Mean Reversion strategy. It is reproduced with
    modification from the following paper:

    Passive Aggressive Mean Reversion strategy switches between a passive and an aggressive mean
    reversion strategy based on epsilon, a measure of sensitivity to the market,
    and hyperparameter C, which denotes the aggressiveness of reverting to a particular strategy.

        Initializes Passive Aggressive Mean Reversion with the given epsilon, aggressiveness,
        and optimzation method.

        :param optimization_method: (int) 0 for PAMR, 1 for PAMR-1, 2 for PAMR-2. All three methods
                                          tend to return similar values.
        :param epsilon: (float) Sensitivity to the market with range of [0, inf). Because the epsilon
                                is considered a threshold and daily returns typically are around 1.
                                It is suggested to keep the range of [0, 1.5]. Typically, the returns
                                are highest with either a value of 0 or 1 for epsilon. 0 indicates
                                active mean reversion for all periods, and 1 indicates passive mean
                                reversion for daily returns below 1.
        :param agg: (float) Aggressiveness to mean reversion with range [0, inf). Aggressiveness
                            does not have much of an impact as epsilon. Typically, 100 has the highest
                            returns for PAMR-1 and 10000 has the highest returns for PAMR-2.
